# About
 - Three times the size of terra, but a fraction of the population
 - 5 years to turn around the sun
 - A day lasts a week, a week a month.
 - There used to be civilisation there, but it was all somehow destroyed/perished. New settlers are there now albeit sparsely.
 - Little to no resources for docking/refueling spacecraft, so not many visitors.
 - It is resistant to supplying anything to the Great Crusade rather other than access to old ruins to tech-priests.
