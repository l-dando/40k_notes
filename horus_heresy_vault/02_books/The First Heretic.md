# Chapter Summaries
0. Prologue:
	0. [[Argel Tal]] was taken (stolen) by the Legion at a young age, specifically by [[Erebus]].
	1. Poem written by [[Cyrene Valantion]].  Writes about [[#The Day of Judgement]], where the [[Ultramarines]] destroy her city of [[Monarchia]], levelling it from orbit and blinding her with the light.
1. Introduces [[Cyrene Valantion]], a person of faith from [[Monarchia]]. Dropships fall who they think is the return of the [[Word Bearers]], but is instead the [[Ultramarines]]. They command the inhabitants to leave the city in the next 7 days. After this, the city is then levelled form orbit.
2. A distress call was sent and received, calling the [[Word Bearers]] to come back to [[Khur]] to help regarding the now-destroyed city of [[Monarchia]]. They travel to the city to find it in ruins.
3. [[Lorgar]] joins them and is hurt. He demands vengeance. He calls out to the [[Ultramarines]] and both [[Guilliman]] and [[Malcador]] come out of a grounded Thunderhawk. They say that the [[Emperor of Mankind]] ordered the destruction of the city. [[Lorgar]] doesn't believe them at first, even striking [[Malcador]]. Then, the [[Emperor of Mankind]] teleports in with a handful of Custodes.
4.  He says that he is disappointed in [[Lorgar]] and that none of the planets he has made compliant have been successes as they treat the Emperor as a God, which he says is not true. After such shame, Lorgar returns to his ship. They all retreat back, but [[Argel Tal]] spots something moving back in the raised city. He finds and returns with a malnourished and injured [[Cyrene Valantion]].
5. [[Lorgar]], [[Kor Phaeron]] and [[Erebus]] discuss the recent event. They still believe the Emperor ***is*** a god, even if he himself won't admit it. They agree to continue their work with their current approach to faith. Lorgar is also going to find [[Magnus]]. 
6. Back with [[Cyrene Valantion]], she has been brought onto the ship and is being spoken to by servitors. Follow up conversations with both [[Xaphen]] and [[Argel Tal]] where they update her on the situation separately. She seems to see through Argel Tal, which he finds uncomfortable but sees value in. [[Xaphen]] explains this to her privately and also says they can fix her sight, as well as that they wish to use her faith for their future endeavors.
7. [[Argel Tal]] recounts what happened on [[47-16]]. They bombarded the planet from orbit, but one city remained. They went down to the planet destroy it, but found there were [[Artificials]] there fighting back that the human population had created. The recruited the assistance of [[Xi-Nu 73]] and his tech-priest creations (Crusaders etc.). Cyrene questioned the difference between these and the [[Artificials]] found on the planet, but [[Argel Tal]] explained those deployed by the Imperium are still part human. They used these to defeat the remaining [[Artificials]]. He ends mentioning [[Aquillon]].
8. [[Aquillon]] is a Custodian, and [[Argel Tal]] noticed how they fight as individual warriors, not as soldiers. He respects their ability, but isn't sure how to feel about how they fight. They finish liberating the planet and all join together for an audience with [[Lorgar]], who forces the [[Custodians]] to depart so he can address the 100,000 [[Word Bearers]] without them listening. They reluctantly do so after the soldiers take aim ~20 of them. [[Lorgar]] tells them two things. One, they are going to go on a pilgrimage to seek the place where gods and moerals meet. Secondly, they are going back to [[Colchis]] (home to [[Argel Tal]]).
9. The [[Word Bearers]] arrive back at [[Colchis]] in the city of **INSERT CITY NAME HERE**, and the few survivors taken from [[Khur]], such as [[Cyrene Valantion]], are being heralded on a level even beyond the Astartes soldiers. She becomes increasingly nervous as she is shepherded through crowds by [[Argel Tal]], [[Xaphen]] and two of their subordinates. She is then questioned by local holy men about what happened back in the city of [[Monarchia]], but before she can go into too much detail she is semi-forced out by [[Argel Tal]]. As they are leaving, they hear a crash high up above them - there is something wrong with the Primarch. 
 
# Major Event
## The Day of Judgement

The [[Ultramarines]] level the city of [[Monarchia]], 7 days after evacuating the city of its inhabitants. This order came from the [[Emperor of Mankind]] himself, believing that when the [[Word Bearers]] previously came to this planet, they caused the city to worship the Emperor as a God. He wanted to make a statement to the [[Word Bearers]] by destroying the city.
