## 🧠 Summary
Perturabo is the Primarch of the Iron Warriors Legion, famed for his mastery of siegecraft, fortifications, and relentless pragmatism. Cold, calculating, and embittered, he is a genius engineer and strategist who views war as mathematics and architecture in motion. His bitterness toward the Emperor and his brothers stems from a lifetime of feeling unappreciated, his talents used but never celebrated. This resentment ultimately drives him to side with [[Horus Lupercal]] during the Heresy.

## ⚔️ Role in the Great Crusade & Horus Heresy
- Commands the Iron Warriors, shaping them into the Imperium’s foremost siege specialists.
- In *Fulgrim*, his Legion is among those summoned to Isstvan V, forming part of the second wave that betrays the loyalists during the Drop Site Massacre. His forces open fire on the remnants of the Iron Hands, Salamanders, and Raven Guard, ensuring their destruction.
- In *The Iron Within*, his Warsmith [[Barabas Dantioch]] is disgraced after losing a fortress to a Hrud migration, leaving him prematurely aged. Perturabo casts him aside, stripping him of favour. This act indirectly leads to Dantioch’s defiance of Horus and his eventual role in the defence of Terra.
- His wider role in the Heresy is as one of Horus’s most dependable generals, bringing siege mastery and brutal efficiency to the traitor cause.

## 🔗 Connections
- Gene‑sire of the Iron Warriors Legion.
- Master of Warsmiths such as [[Barabas Dantioch]] and [[Idriss Krendl]].
- Ally of Horus, Fulgrim, Angron, and Mortarion during the Heresy.
