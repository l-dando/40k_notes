## 🧠 Summary
Angron is the Primarch of the World Eaters Legion, a figure defined by rage, tragedy, and a relentless pursuit of freedom. Born on the brutal world of Nuceria, he was enslaved and forced to fight as a gladiator, his mind scarred by the implantation of the Butcher’s Nails — psycho‑surgical devices that drive him into uncontrollable fury. Though the Emperor sought to make him a general of the Imperium, Angron never forgave being torn from his gladiator brothers and resented the chains of duty placed upon him. His Legion, the World Eaters, mirrors his savagery, embracing close‑quarters slaughter above all else.

## ⚔️ Role in the Great Crusade & Horus Heresy
- **Horus Rising / False Gods**: Present as one of the Primarchs loyal to Horus during the early stages of his corruption. His Legion’s brutality is already infamous, feared even among other Astartes.
- **Galaxy in Flames**: Joins Horus, Fulgrim, and Mortarion in the Isstvan III betrayal. Leads the traitor World Eaters in the virus‑bombed ruins, launching uncontrolled assaults against the loyalists. Personally duels [[Garviel Loken]] until interrupted by a Sons of Horus tank. His savagery epitomises the fratricidal slaughter of the Drop Site Massacre’s precursor.
- **Flight of the Eisenstein**: Though not directly featured, his Legion’s treachery and reputation loom large in the aftermath of Isstvan III, reinforcing his role as one of Horus’s most violent allies.
- **Fulgrim**: Appears among the Primarchs aligned with Horus, his Legion committed to the Warmaster’s rebellion. His presence underscores the growing coalition of traitor Legions.
- **Lord of the Red Sands (short story)**: Rampages across Isstvan III, slaughtering loyalists from the Emperor’s Children, Death Guard, and his own World Eaters. Confronted by Captain [[Kauragar]], who manages to wound his throat before dying. Angron, pleased by his son’s defiance, stays with him as he dies. When asked why he fights for Horus, Angron replies that he does not — he fights only for freedom, no longer the Emperor’s slave.
