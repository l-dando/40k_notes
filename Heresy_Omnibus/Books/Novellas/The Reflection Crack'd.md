## 🧭 Overview
*The Reflection Crack’d* explores the Emperor’s Children in the aftermath of the Drop Site Massacre, charting their descent into Chaos and the growing instability of their Primarch, [[Fulgrim]]. Ordered by [[Horus Lupercal]] to proceed to Mars, Fulgrim instead diverts his Legion to assault a Mechanicus resource world, pursuing his own designs. When questioned, he slays Lord Commander [[Eidolon]] outright, shocking his sons and further exposing his erratic behaviour.

[[Lucius]], increasingly suspicious of his Primarch, begins to study him closely. Disturbed by Fulgrim’s mood swings, lack of camaraderie, and declining swordsmanship, Lucius concludes that Fulgrim is not who he appears to be after witnessing him wield sorcerous powers. Guided by dark dreams, he investigates La Fenice aboard the *Pride of the Emperor*, discovering a portrait of Fulgrim that seems to contain his trapped spirit. Convinced that a daemon has taken his master’s place, Lucius convenes the Brotherhood of the Phoenix. Though despised by his peers, he gains allies in [[Julius Kaesoron]] and [[Fabius Bile]], who reveal their own suspicions and evidence of Fulgrim’s transformation. Together with [[Marius Vairosean]], they ambush and capture their Primarch.

In the Apothecarion, the conspirators torture Fulgrim in an attempt to drive out the possessing entity. Throughout, Fulgrim speaks calmly of his vision for the Legion, until Lucius realises he has misjudged the situation. Fulgrim frees himself effortlessly, revealing the truth: he had indeed been possessed, his spirit trapped in the painting, but he mastered the daemon and reversed their places, imprisoning it instead. The dreams that guided Lucius were the daemon’s attempt to escape. Fulgrim explains that his apparent weaknesses were deliberate ploys to educate Lucius in Chaos’s power, and that his erratic nature is simply the evolution of his being. Declaring his intent to push experience and sensation to their extremes, Fulgrim announces the next step in his journey — to join forces with [[Perturabo]] and the Iron Warriors.
