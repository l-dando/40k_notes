## 🧭 Overview
*The Crimson Fist* follows [[Alexis Polux]] of the Imperial Fists in the aftermath of the Battle of Isstvan III, charting his rise to command and the desperate struggle of the Retribution Fleet against the Iron Warriors. It explores themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and the burden of leadership under impossible odds.

Polux dreams of his initiation on Inwit, recalling how his twin Helias sacrificed himself to save him. Awakening in 006.M31, he is one of the few survivors of ships wrecked by warp storms, rescued by remnants of the Retribution Fleet. With Fleet Master Yonnad dead, command falls to Polux aboard the *Tribune*. He suspects the fleet is trapped in the Phall System, while [[Sigismund]], relieved of command, is tasked by [[Rogal Dorn]] to secure materiel from Mars before it falls to the traitor Mechanicum.

For months, Polux resists calls from Captain [[Amandus Tyr]] to break through the storms, favouring static defence as the fleet suffers losses. Psychic assaults and reconnaissance reveal a transmitter array built around a dead human, feeding intelligence to the traitors. Dorn learns of the Drop Site Massacre and orders Terra’s astropaths to contact the fleet. The Iron Warriors intercept the signal, and [[Perturabo]] personally leads an assault, believing Sigismund to be in command.

Sigismund confesses to Dorn that he remained on Terra because [[Euphrati Keeler]] warned him his Primarch would need him, otherwise he would die at Phall. Dorn, furious, disowns him but orders him to continue as if nothing had changed. The next day, Perturabo’s fleet attacks. Polux’s defensive sphere holds for months, but the Iron Warriors drive a wedge through the Imperial Fists’ lines. Tyr boards the *Iron Blood* to kill Perturabo but is slain. The *Tribune* is boarded, forcing Polux to scuttle her and lead a boarding action against [[Erasmus Golg]]’s *Contrador*. Killing Golg, Polux commandeers the ship and escapes.

Emerging from the warp, the *Contrador* believes it has reached Terra, only to find itself far from home. Polux’s survival and defiance mark him as one of Dorn’s most trusted captains, embodying the resilience of the Imperial Fists in the face of betrayal.
