## 🧭 Overview

His body broken by the fall of the Schadenhold, the Iron Warriors warsmith [[Idriss Krendl]] is nonetheless far from defeated. Now commanding two of the mighty siege guns stolen from the forge world of Diamat, he seeks to redeem himself in the eyes of his primarch by bringing down the Great Selenic palace on Euphoros, and gather invaluable tactical data for the eventual assault on Terra. His plan? To utilise a strategy of his own devising - the glorious Ironfire protocol.
