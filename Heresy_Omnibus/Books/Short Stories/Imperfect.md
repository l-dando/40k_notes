## 🧭 Overview

[[Fulgrim]] and [[Ferrus Manus]] play a game of Regicide. Fulgrim taunts Ferrus with probing questions, asking which of the pieces he identifies with, trying to distract him from his strategy. When Ferrus makes his decisive move, upgrading one of his pieces to "primarch", Fulgrim reveals a hidden piece which converts Ferrus's piece to his side. Enraged, Ferrus tips over the board. Fulgrim reveals himself in his daemonic form and attacks, killing Ferrus. Ferrus is revealed to be a clone created by [[Fabius Bile]] from the true primarch's blood on Fulgrim's sword, and just one of hundreds Fulgrim has made Bile create so he can play the game with them to see if he could ever have succeeded in turning Ferrus to Horus's cause. Leaving Fulgrim to his next game with a new clone, Bile visits his laboratory and it is revealed that he is also growing a clone of Horus.
