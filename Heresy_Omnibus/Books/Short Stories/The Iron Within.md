## 🧭 Overview
*The Iron Within* tells the story of Warsmith [[Barabas Dantioch]], a disgraced Iron Warrior who remains loyal to the Emperor during the Horus Heresy. Set on the barren world of Lesser Damantyne, the tale explores themes of loyalty, defiance, and redemption within a Legion famed for its obedience to [[Perturabo]].

When Warsmith [[Idriss Krendl]] arrives at the Schadenhold fortress to gather forces for Horus’s campaign, Dantioch refuses to join the traitors. Supported by the dreadnought [[Vastopol]] and aided by a disguised clerk revealed to be [[Tauro Nicodemus]], champion of the Ultramarines, Dantioch prepares for a siege. For a year, he and his garrison hold out against Krendl’s forces, using the cavernous environment to delay Horus’s plans and bleed the traitors.

Eventually overwhelmed, Dantioch enacts his contingency plan. Retreating with Nicodemus and Vastopol to a hidden chamber, he triggers detonations that sever the Schadenhold from the cavern ceiling, crushing traitor Titans and much of Krendl’s army. Simultaneously, the loyalists are teleported onto Krendl’s flagship, seizing its bridge. Vastopol dies heroically after being freed from his dreadnought shell, while Dantioch and his allies escape. Accepting Nicodemus’s offer, Dantioch travels to Terra to lend his expertise to the defences of the Imperial Palace, finding renewed purpose in the war.
