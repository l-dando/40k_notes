## 🧭 Overview
*The Wolf of Ash and Fire* presents a mythic vision of the [[Emperor]] and [[Horus Lupercal]] fighting side by side during the Great Crusade against the Orks on Gorro. In this tale, father and son lead their forces against a vast alien empire, embodying unity and perfection in war. The Emperor unleashes His psychic might to devastate the enemy, while Horus commands the Luna Wolves with unmatched skill and ferocity. Together they represent the ideal of the Imperium’s purpose — master and heir, united in conquest. You also meet [[Hastur Sejanus]] and how he interacts with the Mournival.

The story elevates Horus as the “Wolf of Ash and Fire,” a symbol of his destined greatness and the Emperor’s chosen successor. Yet beneath the grandeur lies foreshadowing: the loyalty and bond celebrated here will one day be shattered, turning triumph into tragedy. This short story captures both the glory of Horus’s prime and the shadow of his eventual betrayal.
