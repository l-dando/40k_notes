## 🧭 Overview
*Lord of the Red Sands* takes place during the brutal fighting on Isstvan III, where [[Angron]] leads the traitor World Eaters against the loyalist remnants of their own Legion, as well as those of the Emperor’s Children and Death Guard. The story captures Angron’s ferocity and philosophy, contrasting his savagery with a rare moment of grim compassion.

Rampaging across the battlefield, Angron slaughters countless loyalists until confronted by his own Captain, [[Kauragar]]. In a final act of defiance, Kauragar manages to wound his gene‑sire’s throat — a feat few have ever achieved — before being struck down. Pleased by his son’s courage, Angron remains with him as he dies. With his last breath, Kauragar asks why Angron now fights for Horus. The Primarch replies that he does not: on Nuceria he learned that the only cause worth fighting for is freedom. In siding with Horus, Angron believes he has cast off the Emperor’s chains and become a free man at last.
