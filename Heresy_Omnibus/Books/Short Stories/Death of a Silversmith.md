## 🧭 Overview
*Death of a Silversmith* is a tragic vignette set aboard the *Vengeful Spirit* during the Great Crusade. It follows the final moments of a remembrancer silversmith, reflecting on his life’s work and the honours he has received as his life ebbs away.

Once a celebrated artisan, he gained fame for crafting a display box for an Iron Hands gauntlet, which drew the attention of Imperial agents gathering creative talents to commemorate the Crusade. Reluctantly, he joined the Order of Remembrancers, eventually assigned to the Luna Wolves and the 63rd Expeditionary Fleet. His artistry served the officers, and after the Ullanor Triumph he was commissioned by Captain [[Hastur Sejanus]] to craft four silver rings depicting the phases of the moon, intended for Sejanus and the other members of the [[Mournival]]. Though completed, the demands of war prevented Sejanus from collecting them.

Later, another Captain requested a mold for wolf medallions — a crude task compared to his previous commissions. When the Captain returned to inspect the mold, he pronounced it perfect, then crushed the silversmith’s throat. Dying on the floor of his workshop, the craftsman glimpsed Sejanus rushing to his side, overturning his worktable and accidentally crushing one or more of the Mournival rings. Sejanus called for medics and demanded to know who attacked him. With his last breath, the silversmith whispered the same words his killer had spoken when asked why: *“I can’t say.”*
