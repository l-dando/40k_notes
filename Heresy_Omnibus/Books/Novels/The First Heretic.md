## 🧭 Overview

In 962.M30, the Ultramarines forcibly evacuate the citizens of Monarchia, capital of Khur, before annihilating the city from orbit. Among the survivors is [[Cyrene Valantion]], blinded by the barrage. The Word Bearers — the XVII Legion who brought Khur into compliance — receive the distress call and arrive to find only a wasteland.

On the surface, [[Lorgar Aurelian]] confronts [[Malcador the Sigillite]] over the city’s destruction, striking him in anger. Malcador summons the Emperor, who descends to chastise Lorgar for worshipping Him as a god and for lingering on conquered worlds to spread that faith. As punishment, the Emperor forces the entire Legion to kneel in the dust before departing. Lorgar remains kneeling until lifted by Captain [[Argel Tal]] and Chaplain [[Xaphen]] of the Serrated Sun Chapter. [[Roboute Guilliman]] mocks him, earning a blow to his breastplate from Lorgar’s mace, Illuminarum, but dismisses it as a tantrum. As the Legion withdraws, Argel Tal discovers Cyrene, half‑starved and wounded, and carries her to safety.

In council with [[Kor Phaeron]] and [[Erebus]], a despairing Lorgar hears their argument that the Emperor is a flawed god and that the Imperial Creed was misguided. When Kor Phaeron admits to allowing remnants of Colchis’s Old Way to survive on compliant worlds, Lorgar nearly kills him before being placated. Seeking the truth of divinity, Lorgar is persuaded to undertake the Pilgrimage — an ancient Colchisian quest to find the realm where gods and mortals meet.

The Word Bearers next bring the world of 47‑16 into compliance, battling glass‑bodied automatons with the aid of the Legio Cybernetica’s *Incarnadine*. A detachment of twenty Adeptus Custodes observes their conduct. After the victory, Lorgar dismisses the Custodes from the celebration and announces the Legion will embark on the Pilgrimage — but first, they will return home.

On Colchis, the survivors of Monarchia are revered as martyrs, with Cyrene honoured above all. Argel Tal and his sergeants [[Malnor]], [[Torgal]], and [[Dagotal]] escort her through the City of Grey Flowers while Lorgar retreats to his sanctum to speak with [[Magnus the Red]]. Lorgar questions Magnus about encountering gods in the Warp, but Magnus evades the subject and departs.

Lorgar summons Cyrene, asking her forgiveness for Monarchia’s destruction. Granting her wish to serve the Legion, he names her a Confessor. He then requests Argel Tal’s permission to join the 1,301st Expedition Fleet, to which the Serrated Sun Chapter is attached, declaring that together they will push beyond Imperial borders in search of the gods.

~965.M30 — Three years later, the 1,301st Expedition pushes beyond the edge of Imperial space into a region where the Warp bleeds into reality. The fleet’s chief astropath aboard the *De Profundis* reports a psychic scream from a planet on the storm’s edge. Lorgar, using his limited psychic talent, identifies it as a voice calling his name.

A landing force touches down in the planet’s only wasteland and meets primitive tribespeople clad in human‑skin pelts, tattooed with Colchisian constellations, and speaking what Argel Tal recognises as Colchisian — though Custodian [[Vendatha]] disputes it. Their leader, a girl named [[Ingethel]], claims their coming was foretold and welcomes them to Cadia. Over a week, the Word Bearers study the tribe’s culture, noting deep parallels with ancient Colchis. The Custodes, led by [[Aquillon]], question why the Legion tolerates a society openly worshipping Warp gods.

Argel Tal, Xaphen, and Vendatha accompany Lorgar to an underground ritual, finding nine tribespeople impaled as sacrifices while Ingethel dances. Lorgar is told the rite will reveal the truth of the gods — but he must choose the tenth sacrifice. Vendatha demands the ritual stop and moves to arrest Lorgar. Violence erupts: Vendatha kills Chapter Master [[Deumos]] and two others before being shot by Xaphen and impaled by Argel Tal. Still alive, Vendatha is placed on the tenth spear at Lorgar’s command. The ritual completes, and Ingethel transforms into a daemon, promising to show Lorgar the galaxy’s truth — but first demanding some of his sons as the initial witnesses. Reluctantly, Lorgar chooses Argel Tal and the Seventh Assault Company.

Aboard the *Orfeo’s Lament*, Ingethel’s presence unnerves the crew, culminating in one officer murdering another. Moved to the observation deck, the daemon shows Argel Tal, Xaphen, Malnor, Torgal, and Dagotal visions through Warp sorcery. They witness an Eldar world consumed by the expanding maelstrom and hear the legend of the Fall — a warning that rejecting the “Primordial Truth” doomed the Eldar, and humanity will share their fate if they repeat the mistake.

Next, they are taken to Terra, to the Emperor’s primarch project deep underground. They see the primarchs in their pods, the creation of the first Astartes gene‑seed, and discussion of the lost Second and Eleventh primarchs. Ingethel claims the Emperor bargained with the Warp’s gods to create the primarchs, then built an empire denying divinity. Feeling utterly betrayed, the Word Bearers turn against Him. Argel Tal smashes the cavern’s Geller field generator, triggering the scattering of the primarchs across the galaxy. Briefly returning to the *Orfeo’s Lament*, Tal witnesses several primarchs’ landings before the vision ends.

Ingethel urges them to lower the ship’s Geller field and “embrace the truth.” When they comply, the daemon slaughters them — only for their corpses to rise again, possessed by Warp entities. The Gal Vorbak endure a seven‑month nightmare inside the storm, surviving on cannibalism and blood‑drinking. When they emerge, less than half remain alive — but for the fleet, only seconds have passed. Lorgar instantly senses the daemons within them and imprisons the survivors. Hearing Argel Tal’s account, he records every detail before deciding their fate.

Lorgar releases the survivors, embracing the ugly truth they have learned, and prepares to journey into the Eye of Terror with Ingethel. On his orders, Argel Tal exterminates the Cadian tribes from orbit to erase evidence. In training with Aquillon, Tal lies about Vendatha’s death; Aquillon thanks him and congratulates him on his promotion to Chapter Master. Lorgar presides over the ceremony, naming Tal and Xaphen leaders of the Serrated Sun and of the Gal Vorbak — the possessed elite of the Legion. In secret, he orders them to hide their nature until the time comes to declare open rebellion, and to block any reports Aquillon sends to Terra.

005.M31 — Forty years later, Argel Tal leads the 1,301st Expedition as “the Crimson Lord.” Xaphen returns from four years spent cultivating warrior lodges within the Iron Warriors and discusses the vast conspiracy uniting the traitor Legions. The Serrated Sun, now larger than ever, wages war on a non‑compliant human world. Argel Tal and Aquillon fight side‑by‑side through the enemy palace, their skill honed by years of sparring. Mid‑battle, all Gal Vorbak are simultaneously incapacitated by the daemons within them awakening, but they recover to finish the fight. Soon after, news arrives that [[Horus Lupercal]] has rebelled.

The Word Bearers join the Iron Warriors, Night Lords, and Alpha Legion at Isstvan V. The primarchs brief their captains on the battle below between loyalist Iron Hands, Salamanders, and Raven Guard, and Horus’s rebels. Now fully awakened, Argel Tal’s symbiotic daemon [[Raum]] speaks to him, explaining their bond and prophesying they will “die in the shadow of great wings.” The second‑wave Legions land and fortify the drop site. At the forefront, Argel Tal and the Gal Vorbak meet the retreating Raven Guard. Thinking of his long‑dead family, Tal silently asks forgiveness before ordering his men to open fire.

In the Drop Site Massacre, the Gal Vorbak’s daemons take control, transforming them into monstrous battle‑forms. They butcher loyalists until [[Corvus Corax]] attacks, killing half of them before confronting Lorgar. The primarchs duel, awakening Argel Tal’s full daemonic potential and transforming him into a massive beast. Lorgar is nearly slain before [[Konrad Curze]] intervenes, forcing Corax to withdraw. [[Dagotal]] is incinerated by Raven Guard flam

- Dark Apostles serve as the ideological backbone for the [[Drop Site Massacre]].  
- [[Cadia]]’s early exposure to Chaos foreshadows its later role as the Imperium’s bulwark.

## 🔗 Connections
- Builds on the censure event on [[Monarchia]] from earlier volumes.  
- Foreshadows the [[Drop Site Massacre]] at [[Isstvan V]].  
- Sets the stage for *Galaxy in Flames* and the wider Horus Heresy series.
