# 🧭 Overview

---

## Book One — Terra Figula
Perturabo’s earliest memory is of climbing a cliff on Olympia, foreshadowing a lifetime of struggle and defiance. In the present, the Iron Warriors besiege the Cadmean Citadel on Hydra Cordatus. After months of grinding warfare, Perturabo personally intervenes to break the Imperial Fists’ defence, promoting the brutal [[Kroeger]] and demoting the reckless [[Harkor]].

The Emperor’s Children arrive unexpectedly, shocking the Iron Warriors with their mutated decadence. Fulgrim introduces an Aeldari guide, Karuchi Vohra, and demands Perturabo construct the Thaliakron so he can recount the legend of the Angel Exterminatus — a weapon of unimaginable power. Hidden Shattered Legion operatives, [[Sabik Wayland]] and [[Nykona Sharrowkyn]], attempt to assassinate Fulgrim, but he survives.

Fulgrim reveals his true goal: to enter a warp rift and claim the Angel Exterminatus. Perturabo reluctantly agrees, warning the Trident (Forrix, Falk, Kroeger) not to trust the Emperor’s Children. Meanwhile, Fabius Bile experiments on captured Imperial Fists, and Fulgrim secretly plots to resurrect the Angel Exterminatus for himself.

## Book Two — As Above, So Below
On Medusa IV, a vision of [[Ferrus Manus]] hunts a wyrm, symbolising the lingering trauma of Fulgrim’s fratricide.

Fulgrim, haunted by memories, reconvenes the Brotherhood of the Phoenix. On the Sisypheum, the Shattered Legions prepare to oppose the traitors. Cassander attempts to kill Fabius but is transformed into a terata monstrosity. The loyalists navigate the Paths Below while the traitors approach the warp rift — now named the **Eye of Terror** by Perturabo.

Tensions rise within both Legions. Eidolon attempts to corrupt Vull Bronn, Grendel intervenes, and Thamatica’s experiments expose the Sisypheum’s location. Perturabo boards the loyalist ship, slaughtering defenders while Fabius raids the apothecarion. A catastrophic energy spike forces the Iron Warriors to evacuate their Primarch. Thamatica overcharges the Sisypheum’s reactors, sending it crashing through the Emperor’s Children flagship. Perturabo allows the loyalists to escape as punishment for Fulgrim’s deceit.

Perturabo confronts Fulgrim, asserting command of the expedition.

## Book Three — Coniunctio
On Chemos, Fulgrim’s origin is retold: a miraculous child found in a polluted wasteland, destined for greatness.

The traitors reach the Crone World Iydris, whose very landscape resists them. As they advance through the haunted sepulchre, the Emperor’s Children succumb to sensory madness while Aeldari spirits rise to defend their dead world. Shattered Legion survivors infiltrate the complex from another route.

Fulgrim reveals his true plan: to sacrifice Perturabo and ascend as the Angel Exterminatus. A gemstone gifted to Perturabo secretly drains his life. The Iron Warriors fracture under internal betrayal as Toramino shells Forrix’s position, and Kroeger kills Harkor in a frenzy.

Fulgrim rises through the sepulchre’s core, leaving Perturabo dying. Eidolon begins the ritual sacrifice — but Perturabo seizes the gemstone and confronts Fulgrim in a vision of an Olympia that never was. He hurls the artifact away, only for Branthan’s psyber‑eagle to snatch it.

The loyalists strike: Numen kills Marius Vairosean, Grendel destroys Bombastus, and Sharrowkyn slays Lucius. The gemstone is shattered, freeing Perturabo to strike Fulgrim. The Primarch of the Emperor’s Children splits open and ascends as a Daemon Prince of Slaanesh, whisking his Legion away.

As Iydris collapses, Perturabo leads his sons to safety and orders the fleet into the black hole consuming the Crone World. Lucius, resurrected by Slaanesh, awakens amid Fabius’s laboratory as the terata burn, leaving only one gene‑sample intact.
