## 🧭 Overview

In the Nurth campaign of c. 003.M31, the Geno Five‑Two Chiliad’s Jokers, led by Hetman [[Hurtado Bronzi]] and [[Peto Soneka]], are drawn into a shadow war between the Imperium, the alien Cabal, and the elusive [[Alpharius Omegon]] of the Alpha Legion. After an ambush on Soneka’s company is broken by Alpha Legion intervention, a chain of assassinations, covert meetings, and shifting loyalties begins to unfold.

[[John Grammaticus]], a human Perpetual working for the Cabal under the alias Konig Heniker, infiltrates the Nurthene city of Mon Lo and becomes entangled with Uxor [[Rukhsana Saiid]]. The Cabal manipulates events to bring the Alpha Legion into the warzone, intending to use the campaign as a demonstration of the true threat of the Primordial Annihilator — Chaos itself. The Nurthene’s possession of a mysterious Black Cube, a warp‑empowered weapon, raises the stakes.

Lord Commander [[Teng Namatjira]] of the 670th Expedition Fleet grows suspicious of the Alpha Legion’s role, even as Alpharius secures his cooperation to use Imperial psykers. Amid dust storms and mass Nurthene assaults, Grammaticus convinces Alpharius that the Black Cube’s activation will render Nurth uninhabitable within a day, prompting a withdrawal.

Months later, in the 42 Hydra System, Grammaticus is held prisoner aboard the Alpha Legion’s Battle Barge *Beta*. Soneka frees him and Saiid, leading them to the Cabal’s hidden meeting site. There, Alpharius demands proof of the coming civil war. The Cabal — represented by the alien Gahet and the psyker Shere — subjects Alpharius, Soneka, and Shere to the Acuity, a psychic vision showing two futures: one where the Emperor wins and Chaos reigns eternally, and one where Horus wins, humanity dies, and Chaos starves.

Accepting the Cabal’s logic, Alpharius commits the Alpha Legion to Horus’s cause. In the ensuing betrayal, Namatjira and Dinas Chayne are killed, the Geno are abandoned to die as the planet’s artificial atmosphere is shut down, and the remnants of the 670th Fleet are destroyed. Soneka rescues Bronzi, but aboard the Cabal’s ship, Grammaticus — wracked with guilt — ends his own life, believing he has doomed his species.

The Alpha Legion departs, their true motives known only to themselves, poised to play their part in the Horus Heresy.
