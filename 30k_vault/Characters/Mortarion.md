## 🧠 Summary
One of the Emperor’s twenty primarchs, Mortarion is the master of the Death Guard Legion. Raised on the toxic world of Barbarus, he is grim, austere, and relentless, embodying endurance and resistance to hardship. Mortarion despises psykers and sorcery, favouring attrition and resilience in war. Though once loyal to the Emperor, he harbours bitterness over his past and becomes one of the first primarchs to side with [[Horus Lupercal]] in rebellion.
