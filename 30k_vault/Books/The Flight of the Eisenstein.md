## 🧭 Overview

### Part One — The Blinded Star
In the build‑up to the Horus Heresy, the Death Guard battle the alien Jorgall in their bottle‑ships. Battle‑Captain [[Nathaniel Garro]] of the 7th Great Company leads part of the assault, securing victory. Soon after, the Legion travels to the Isstvan system under the pretence of crushing rebellion on Isstvan III.

In a preliminary assault, the Death Guard and Emperor’s Children encounter a Warsinger whose sonic powers devastate the loyalists. Garro is badly wounded, his torso and leg shattered, before Lord Commander [[Eidolon]] kills the Warsinger with an illegal sonic organ implanted by [[Fabius Bile]]. Recuperating in‑fleet, Garro is deemed too loyal to the Emperor to be trusted with Horus’s rebellion, yet too injured to be sent to the surface to die in the virus‑bombing. As a solution, he is given joint command of the frigate *Eisenstein* alongside Captain [[Ignatius Grulgor]], secretly ordered to kill him. Before Grulgor can act, Garro is contacted by [[Saul Tarvitz]], who warns him of Horus’s imminent betrayal.

### Part Two — A Sundered Vow
Tarvitz’s warning spurs Garro to act. He orders the *Eisenstein* to fire on traitor craft pursuing Tarvitz to the surface, then confronts Grulgor. A brutal skirmish ends with Grulgor and his men ejected into the void. Garro prepares to take the *Eisenstein* into the Warp to carry word of Horus’s treachery to Terra.

As preparations are made, a Thunderhawk carrying [[Kyril Sindermann]], [[Euphrati Keeler]], [[Mersadie Oliton]], and [[Iacton Qruze]] makes contact. Confirming their loyalty, Garro brings them aboard. The *Eisenstein* attempts its Warp jump but is targeted by the *Terminus Est*, flagship of First Captain [[Calas Typhon]]. The frigate escapes but suffers heavy damage.

In the Warp, the Geller field fails, allowing a horde of rotting Plague Marines to board — the corpses of Grulgor and his men, resurrected by Nurgle. Garro and his warriors fight them off, but [[Solun Decius]] is poisoned by their weapons. The *Eisenstein* drifts stranded until it is rescued by [[Rogal Dorn]] and the Imperial Fists.

### Part Three — Unbroken
Brought to Terra, Garro and his companions convince Dorn of Horus’s betrayal, aided by Keeler’s testimony. They are confined in the fortress of the Sisters of Silence on Luna. There, Decius succumbs to Nurgle’s corruption, transforming into the monstrous “Lord of the Flies.” He rampages through the fortress until Garro finally slays him on the lunar surface.

Summoned before [[Malcador the Sigillite]], Garro, Qruze, and Sister [[Amendera Kendel]] are addressed in a speech that implies they will form the nucleus of a new order — the first agents of what will become the Inquisition.
