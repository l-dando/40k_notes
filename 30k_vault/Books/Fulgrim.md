## 🧭 Overview

### Part One — The Perfect Warrior
Aboard the *Pride of the Emperor*, remembrancers [[Serena d’Angelus]] and [[Ostian Delafour]] attend [[Bequa Kynska]]’s recital while the Second and Third Companies fight the Laer on Atoll 19. At the war council, [[Fulgrim]] vows to cleanse the planet within a month. With Atoll 19 secured, the campaign begins in earnest as the full 28th Expedition arrives. Delafour rejects Kynska’s advances.

As the campaign nears its end, [[Fabius Bile]] convinces Fulgrim to experiment with Laer physiology to “perfect” the Legion. At a Brotherhood of the Phoenix meeting, Fulgrim announces they will next join the Iron Hands in the Perdus Anomaly, while [[Eidolon]] is dispatched to oversee conquered territories. Fulgrim personally leads the final assault, entering a Laer temple and seizing the Silver Blade, before ordering the extermination of the xenos.

### Part Two — The Phoenix and the Gorgon
In the Perdus Anomaly, the Diasporex evade Iron Hands patrols, prompting Fulgrim’s fleet to assist. Aboard the *Pride of the Emperor*, Delafour works on a marble statue, while Captain [[Solomon Demeter]] recovers from wounds sustained against the Laer. Fulgrim deduces the Diasporex must refuel before escaping. Eidolon agrees to sponsor Fabius’s research, demanding to be remade as Fulgrim’s greatest warrior. D’Angelus, obsessed with the Laer temple, begins painting with blood. First Captain [[Julius Kaesoron]] immerses himself in the works of Cornelius Blayke. Fulgrim, goaded by a voice in his head, rages when [[Ferrus Manus]] springs a trap on the Diasporex without consulting him. At the Battle of the Carollis Star, the Imperials are victorious, but Fulgrim resents the acclaim given to others.

### Part Three — Visions of Treachery
The fleet pushes deeper into the Anomaly. [[Eldrad Ulthran]] of Ulthwé observes Fulgrim’s corruption, while Kaesoron embraces Blayke’s philosophy of sensation. Delafour angers Fulgrim by claiming art is passion, not perfection. The fleet discovers idyllic worlds; Fulgrim initially declares them untouched, but Demeter suspects the Laer temple has corrupted the Legion. D’Angelus murders poet [[Leopold Cadmus]] to fuel her art.

On Tarsus, Ulthran warns Fulgrim of Horus’s imminent betrayal. Fulgrim dismisses him, and when Ulthran realises Fulgrim is already tainted by Slaanesh, he orders his warriors to attack. The Imperials prevail, and Fulgrim, enraged, orders the worlds virus‑bombed.

### Part Four — Threshold
Terran emissary [[Ormond Braxton]] raises concerns about Fulgrim’s conduct, which the Primarch mocks before returning to d’Angelus’s distorted portrait of him. D’Angelus confesses Cadmus’s murder to [[Lucius]], who adopts her self‑scarification. In Auretian Technocracy space, Fulgrim meets Horus and [[Erebus]], who convince him the Emperor has betrayed them. Fulgrim agrees to join the rebellion.

In the Callidenes System, a plot to kill Demeter with Orks fails thanks to [[Saul Tarvitz]], but Fulgrim kills [[Vespasian]] in the aftermath. Eidolon leads the bulk of the Legion to Isstvan III. Aboard the *Fist of Iron*, Fulgrim attempts to sway Ferrus to Horus’s cause. They fight, and the Emperor’s Children escape after their fleet opens fire on the Iron Hands. During Isstvan III, Lucius tricks Demeter into killing his own men and abandons him to die.

### Part Five — The Last Phoenix
On Isstvan V, Fulgrim confronts Delafour and impales him on his own statue of the Emperor. D’Angelus, grief‑stricken, commits suicide. Kynska unveils her masterpiece, the *Maraviglia*, recreating the Laer temple’s acoustics. The performance becomes a massacre as Daemonettes and newly reborn Noise Marines slaughter the audience.

The Drop Site Massacre begins. The Iron Hands, Salamanders, and Raven Guard form the first wave against the traitors. The second wave — Iron Warriors, Night Lords, Word Bearers, and Alpha Legion — arrives and opens fire on the loyalists. Refusing to retreat, Ferrus leads a renewed attack against the Emperor’s Children. He and Fulgrim duel; Fulgrim beheads Ferrus, then succumbs to the voice haunting him, allowing a daemon to possess his body. In the aftermath, the traitors celebrate their triumph, and Horus vows to find a way to free his brother.
