## 🧭 Overview

Warmaster [[Horus Lupercal]] has secretly fallen to Chaos, his rebellion known only to a trusted inner circle. Primarchs [[Angron]], [[Mortarion]], and [[Fulgrim]] have pledged their Legions — the World Eaters, Death Guard, and Emperor’s Children — to his cause. Under the pretence of suppressing an Isstvannian rebellion, the four Legions gather in the Isstvan system.

Aboard the *Vengeful Spirit*, the unconscious [[Euphrati Keeler]] has become the focus of a growing cult venerating the Emperor as a god, with [[Kyril Sindermann]] among her believers. Horus questions Chief Astropath [[Ing Mae Sing]] about her, after which Sing sends a psychic warning to Sindermann. Sindermann enlists [[Titus Cassar]] of the Legio Mortis and his reluctant friend [[Jonah Aruken]] to help rescue Keeler. They find her about to be killed by [[Maggard]], now a gene‑enhanced enforcer for Horus. As Maggard attacks, Keeler awakens, slowing his movements with her powers, allowing the rescuers to escape into the ship’s lower decks. Horus sacrifices Sing to gain an audience with the powers of Chaos.

Meanwhile, the Emperor’s Children and Death Guard assault an enemy station on Isstvan Extremis, encountering a Warsinger. Death Guard Captain [[Nathaniel Garro]] is badly wounded, but Lord Commander [[Eidolon]] kills the Warsinger with a sonic shriek — arousing the suspicion of [[Saul Tarvitz]]. Taken to [[Fabius Bile]]’s laboratory, Tarvitz is shown the surgical enhancements being made to Legionaries and offered a place in the “new order.” Horrified, he refuses. Soon after, an assault force — hand‑picked by Horus and including [[Garviel Loken]], [[Tarik Torgaddon]], and [[Lucius]] — descends on Isstvan III’s capital.

Suspicious of the assault force’s composition, Tarvitz remains in the fleet and discovers virus bombs being loaded into the guns. Realising the surface forces are about to be betrayed, he steals a Thunderhawk and flees for the planet. Pursued by traitor Emperor’s Children, he turns to Garro, who believes his warning and has the *Eisenstein* destroy the pursuing craft. Tarvitz lands undetected.

On the surface, loyalist elements of all four Legions — those deemed too faithful to the Emperor to join Horus — fight the Isstvannian rebels. Lucius leads the Emperor’s Children against the Precentor’s Palace, killing Governor [[Vardus Praal]] and taking the building. Tarvitz arrives, warning of the impending virus strike, and sends Lucius to alert the Sons of Horus and Death Guard while he warns the World Eaters. Keeler, awakened by a vision of the attack, transmits it to Sindermann and [[Mersadie Oliton]].

Some Emperor’s Children and Sons of Horus reach shelter, but few World Eaters or Death Guard survive. Horus follows the virus‑bombing with an orbital firestorm, igniting the atmosphere. In the Legio Mortis Titan *Dies Irae*, Aruken and Cassar survive thanks to loyalist princeps [[Esau Turnet]]’s forewarning. Realising the truth, Cassar attacks Turnet and begs Aruken’s help, but his faith in the Emperor alienates Aruken, who kills him.

In orbit, Horus gathers the remembrancers to witness the destruction, then orders their massacre. Keeler leads Sindermann and Oliton to [[Iacton Qruze]], the Sons of Horus’ overlooked Third Captain. They fight and kill Maggard, steal a Thunderhawk, and escape to the *Eisenstein*, where Garro takes them aboard.

Enraged by the loyalists’ survival, Angron launches an unsanctioned World Eaters assault. Ordered to support him, Horus commits the traitor Emperor’s Children and Death Guard, turning the planned extermination into a grinding ground war. Tarvitz emerges as the loyalists’ commander, holding off repeated traitor attacks. Jealous of Tarvitz’s acclaim, Lucius murders Chaplain [[Charmosian]] and bargains with Eidolon, betraying the loyalists for a place among the traitors.

Horus sends the Sons of Horus under [[Serghar Targost]] and [[Luc Sedirae]], while dispatching [[Ezekyle Abaddon]] and [[Horus Aximand]] to confront Loken and Torgaddon. Eidolon’s assault breaches the palace, slaughtering the wounded. Loken and Torgaddon leave to meet Abaddon and Aximand, but Loken is intercepted by [[Khârn]] until a Sons of Horus tank crushes them both. Tarvitz discovers Lucius’s treachery; they duel, and Tarvitz gains the upper hand by mimicking a move Loken once used, but Lucius escapes. Tarvitz rallies his forces to repel Eidolon’s undisciplined attack.

In the ruins of the parliament building, Loken duels Abaddon while Torgaddon fights Aximand. Aximand kills Torgaddon, leaving Loken at Abaddon’s mercy. Before Abaddon can finish him, the *Dies Irae* collapses the building. Believing Loken dead, the traitors withdraw. With the loyalists shattered, Horus firebombs the city. Tarvitz and the few survivors brace for the end, knowing they have bought time for Garro to reach Terra. Beneath the rubble, Loken’s last sight is the bombs falling.
