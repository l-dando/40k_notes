## 🧭 Overview

In the 203rd year of the Great Crusade, [[Horus Lupercal]] has been Warmaster for barely a year, entrusted with command of the Emperor’s armies after the Master of Mankind’s return to Terra. The 63rd Expedition Fleet’s first major campaign under his leadership is the pacification of Sixty‑Three Nineteen — a human world ruled by a sovereign styling himself “The Emperor of Mankind.” When Horus’s envoy, Captain [[Hastur Sejanus]], is murdered by the ruler’s bodyguards, the “Invisibles,” war becomes inevitable.

Four companies, led by [[Ezekyle Abaddon]], [[Tarik Torgaddon]], [[Horus Aximand]], and [[Garviel Loken]], spearhead the assault on the palace. Victory comes swiftly, with Horus himself slaying the false Emperor. In the aftermath, the newly‑formed Council of Terra assigns remembrancers — artists, historians, and poets — to document the Crusade. Among them, [[Mersadie Oliton]] befriends Loken, becoming a trusted confidante.

Loken is invited to join the Mournival, the Warmaster’s informal council of four captains, replacing Sejanus. Though he doubts his worthiness, his mentor, Iterator [[Kyril Sindermann]], assures him that his humanity is precisely why he is needed. Meanwhile, poet [[Ignace Karkasy]] courts trouble with his outspoken criticism of the Imperium’s conquest, nearly beaten to death by enraged Imperial Army troops.

A final rebel holdout remains in the Whisperhead Mountains. Horus wants the Luna Wolves unleashed, but has Loken volunteer the 10th Company to take the stronghold. [[Rogal Dorn]] privately tells Loken he recommended him for the Mournival to temper the other captains’ extremes, but warns that the role also involves playing Horus’s political games.

As the assault begins, eerie vox‑whispers spread through the ranks: “Samus is all around you.” The fortress falls easily, but Sergeant [[Xavyer Jubal]] begins raving about Samus, murders his squad, and attacks Loken. Forced to kill him, Loken calls for Sindermann, who suspects a sickness — until Jubal’s corpse mutates into a monstrous form. At the same time, remembrancers led by [[Euphrati Keeler]] slip away from their escort to witness the battlefield, only to be attacked by the daemon. Loken kills it before it can take Keeler’s life.

Afterwards, Abaddon warns Loken to keep silent. Horus reassures him, explaining that Jubal was possessed by a warp entity — a “daemon” — and that certain places, like the Whisperheads, are thin to the Immaterium. The Emperor’s withdrawal from the Crusade, Horus reveals, is to master the warp itself; if He fails, all the victories of the Great Crusade will be meaningless.

The Crusade moves on, answering a distress call from the Blood Angels on One‑Forty Twenty — a world dubbed “Murder.” The Emperor’s Children arrive first under Lord Commander [[Eidolon]], who ignores protocol and drops immediately into battle against the insectoid Megarachnids. Captains [[Saul Tarvitz]] and [[Lucius]] fight for survival amid electromagnetic storms that scatter forces and block vox‑links.

En route, Loken discovers that Jubal and even his trusted second, [[Nero Vipus]], were members of the secretive Warrior Lodges spreading through the Legions. Invited by Aximand to observe a meeting, Loken finds no heresy — only camaraderie — but remains uneasy about the secrecy. Sindermann, shaken by recent events, obsessively researches daemons. Keeler privately shows Loken pict‑evidence of the daemon in the Whisperheads, entrusting him with it and revealing her private worship of the Emperor.

On Murder, Tarvitz’s decision to destroy the Megarachnid “trees” clears the storms and allows the Luna Wolves to land in force. Torgaddon bonds with Tarvitz, unimpressed by Eidolon’s arrogance. The war drags on for months until [[Sanguinius]] arrives with Blood Angels reinforcements, and the Megarachnids are finally exterminated. A human civilisation, the Interex, arrives, revealing Murder was a penal colony for the Megarachnids and chastising the Imperium for ignoring their warnings.

Horus seeks peaceful relations with the Interex, travelling to their homeworld for negotiations. The Interex, human in origin but culturally blended with xenos allies, keep the Imperium at arm’s length. Many Luna Wolves urge conquest, but Horus insists on exhausting diplomacy. In a private moment, he confides to the Mournival his deep sense of responsibility and his willingness to bend Imperial orthodoxy to avoid needless war.

At a reception, Loken learns from an Interex guard that they fear the taint of “Kaos” in the newcomers — a threat described by the Eldar as insidious and destructive. Loken begins to bridge understanding, but before progress can be made, an alarm sounds: the Interex’s museum of dangerous xenos artefacts has been breached. Believing the Astartes responsible, the Interex attack. Horus’s pleas for a cease‑fire are ignored, and the Luna Wolves fight through the city.

The Interex are subjugated, but Loken takes no pride in the victory, born of a misunderstanding over the theft of an anathame — a semi‑sentient weapon forged by one of the Interex’s subject races. Horus denies involvement, but in secret, First Chaplain [[Erebus]] of the Word Bearers examines the stolen blade aboard the *Vengeful Spirit*, contemplating its potential. Keeler thanks the Emperor for placing humanity’s fate in Horus’s hands, as the Luna Wolves are renamed the Sons of Horus. Loken tells Oliton their next destination: a small moon in the Davin System, at Erebus’s request…
