## 🧭 Overview  
Cadia is a remote, forested world visited during Lorgar’s pilgrimage. At this point in the timeline, it is not yet part of the Imperium and is inhabited by tribal humans who unknowingly worship the Chaos pantheon. The planet’s proximity to the Eye of Terror makes it a spiritually volatile location.

## ⚔️ Key Events  
- [[Lorgar Aurelian]] and the Word Bearers land on Cadia during their journey into the Eye of Terror.  
- The native tribes display ritualistic reverence for the four Chaos gods, foreshadowing the planet’s future significance.  
- [[Kor Phaeron]] and [[Erebus]] observe the cultural alignment with Chaos and use it to reinforce Lorgar’s evolving beliefs.  
- To prevent the truth of Cadia’s worship from spreading, the Word Bearers purge the tribes from orbit.

## 🔗 Connections  
- Cadia’s early exposure to Chaos sets the foundation for its future role as a strategic buffer against the Eye of Terror.  
- The planet’s destruction by the Word Bearers ensures its later resettlement as a loyalist bastion in Imperial history.

## 📝 Notes  
- The pylons that later become central to Cadia’s lore are not yet discovered or acknowledged at this stage.  
- The planet’s spiritual resonance makes it a key waypoint in Lorgar’s ideological transformation.
