## 🧭 Overview  
Isstvan V is named in *The First Heretic* as the future site of the Horus Heresy’s first massive betrayal. Though no character actually lands there yet, rumours among the Word Bearers and Dark Apostles cast it as the trap-world where loyalist reinforcements will be slaughtered.

## ⚔️ Known Mentions  
- Foreshadowed as the Drop Site for the Second Wave of loyalist Legions  
- Cited in secret orders and corrupted deployment codes circulated by [[Erebus]]  
- Framed by [[Lorgar Aurelian]]’s Dark Apostles as the turning point of open rebellion  

## 🔗 Connections  
- See [[Major Events/Drop Site Massacre]] for full context on the ambush plans  
- Links back to Word Bearers’ pilgrimage and spreading of Chaos propaganda in *The First Heretic*  

## 📝 Notes  
- At this stage, it remains an off-page threat—no ground action is shown in the narrative yet  
- Its status as a “Dead World” arises from the planned virus bombing of Isstvan III and subsequent fallout
