overview: >
  The Drop Site Massacre was the secret ambush at Isstvan V where Horus’s Traitor Legions turned on their unsuspecting Loyalist kin.  In less than three hours, the Alpha Legion, Night Lords, Iron Warriors and Word Bearers—having infiltrated the second‐wave deployment—opened fire on the Iron Hands, Salamanders and Raven Guard.  This first open slaughter of the Horus Heresy decimated three Loyalist Legions and marked the irreversible fracture of the Imperium.

## ⚔️ Key Details  
- Under orders from Horus Lupercal, four Traitor Legions in the second wave revealed their true allegiance and struck the first‐wave Loyalist Legions during planetfall.  
- Betrayer forces included the Alpha Legion, Night Lords, Iron Warriors and Word Bearers hidden among Sons of Horus, World Eaters, Death Guard and Emperor’s Children.  
- Loyalist commanders Ferrus Manus, Corvus Corax and Vulkan led the Iron Hands, Raven Guard and Salamanders into the trap, suffering catastrophic losses.  
- The battle raged for approximately three hours before the Traitors sealed their victory and withdrew, leaving Istvan V littered with the dead of both sides.

## 🔗 Connections  
- Foreshadowed in *The First Heretic* via corrupted deployment orders and whispered omens.  
- Fully depicted in *Galaxy in Flames* and later Horus Heresy novels.  
- The shattered Loyalist Legions earn the moniker “Shattered Legions” and reshape Rogal Dorn’s strategy for retaking rebellion worlds.

## 📝 Notes  
- Sometimes called the “Battle of Isstvan V,” it stands as the Heresy’s first major turning point.  
- The slaughter demonstrated Chaos’s ruthless willingness to betray sworn oaths.  
- Casualty figures remain approximate, but the event’s scale devastated the Iron Hands, Raven Guard and Salamanders beyond immediate recovery.
